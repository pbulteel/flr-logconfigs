SAP FlexiLogReader Config files. (lcf)

These are lcf files (configuration files/parsers) that can be used with the SAP FlexiLogReader written by Graham Sturmy at SAP.

SAP FlexiLogReader can be found at SAP's SCN page below.

The FLR already comes with a few lcf files which allow you to read and parse some logs. These are mainly focused on some of SAPs products (mainly SAP BusinessObjects) but the log reader works quite well to read other log files using these lcf files.

Here are a few of the ones that I have created/modified to be use with FLR 3.0.2 and that I use regurlarly.

The files are free for use. SAP FlexiLogReader however is not licensed by me. Please refer to the license file included with FLR.
